Hello! My name is Harley, and I'm a Filipino Student Developer. If I'm Not Coding I usually do other hobbies. I'm Studying remotely while creating projects that could improve my abilities as a programmer.

I have a huge interest in UX/UI Design as well as coding. I'm currently learning mobile development with Java language using Android Studio

Currently I'm studying at STI San Pablo with the course ICT - Mobile and Web Development

I love to join different communities and competition that invlolve creating something for the society.




Here Are the Tools and Languages I Use in Development:
